            <h2>Creating a React Wrapper for an LLM Project</h2>
            <p>
                One of my recent projects involved building a frontend for a local large language model (LLM) to
                complement a suite of Analytic tools. This project was my first major undertaking since completing
                server side and getting through the basics of AI integration. The tools present a clean react based
                interface with dynamic page generation for hundreds of analytic methodologies.</p>
            <p>
                Each Structured Analytic Technique or SAT is a React component that can be rendered dynamically based on
                user input. The challenge was to create a wrapper that could handle the state management and API calls
                without becoming overly complex. I wanted to keep it simple, so I used React’s built-in hooks for state
                and effects. In a nutshell, I took in a user input, fed it into a strucutred system prompt, then parsed
                the results back to the user.</p>
            <p>
                While I can't get into too much detail on how I trained the model, I can say that it was an awesome
                project that T's up a lot of future work. The LLM can now handle complex queries and provide insights
                based on the structured data it receives. The next step is to integrate this with a more robust backend
                that can handle larger datasets and more complex queries.</p>
