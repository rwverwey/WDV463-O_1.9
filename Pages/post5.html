            <h2>Building My First React Native App</h2>
            <p>
                I started learning React Native yesterday and decided to build a simple mobile app to apply what I’m learning.
                Since I already use React for web projects, the syntax and component structure felt familiar.
                I’m using Expo to speed up development and test on my phone without dealing with platform-specific setup.

                The app I’m building is a <strong>Migraine Log</strong>. It’s a basic CRUD tool where users can create, read, update,
                and delete migraine entries. Each entry includes a date, severity, trigger, symptom, and any medication taken.
                I’m storing the data locally for now using async storage, and keeping the interface minimal so I can focus on getting the core functionality working.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project is helping me learn the essentials of mobile app structure: navigation between screens,
                state management, form handling, and persistent storage. It’s nothing fancy, but it works—and it’s a solid first step into mobile development with React Native.
