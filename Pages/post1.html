      <h2>Deploying with Gatsby</h2>
      <p>
        When I first looked at Gatsby, I expected more of a learning curve since most of the static site generators I've
        worked with in past months haven't been user friendly. Gatsby’s documentation is clear, the CLI gets you up and
        running fast, and the plugin ecosystem takes care of most heavy lifting. Within the first ten minutes, my demo
        site was online without an issue. I would much rather utilize gatsby than IONOS or any other hosting service.
      </p>
      <p>
        What stood out to me was how it bridges modern frontend tooling with static deployment. I hooked it into a
        GitHub repo, linked it to Netlify, and every commit deployed automatically. I'm a firm believer in keeping
        things simple, and Gatsby's approach to static generation fits that philosophy perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’d recommend Gatsby to anyone looking to spin up a personal blog, documentation site, or small portfolio
        project. It's fast, clean, and honestly kind of fun once you realize how much is handled for you.
